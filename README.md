# MIPS Calculator

This program is written in Assembly for the MIPS processor and performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus) on two integers input by the user.

## Features
- Supports the following arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
  
- Takes two integer inputs from the user and performs the selected operation.
- Displays the result of the operation.
- Allows users to perform multiple calculations by entering `yes` when asked if they want to calculate again.

## How to Use
1. Run the program in a MIPS simulator (such as QtSPIM).
2. The program will prompt you to enter a number.
3. After entering the first number, it will prompt you to enter an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
4. The program will then ask you for the second number and compute the result of the operation.
5. If you want to perform another calculation, the program will ask if you'd like to continue (type `yes` to continue, `no` to exit).
